Google Earth Engine is an online platform that performs geospatial data analysis, basically big scale satellite and any other Earth observation data processing. It hosts petabytes of imagery from Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, and many more. Any user can run the most complex environmental analyses at global, regional, or local scales using GEE. It provides powerful tools to analyze satellite imagery; it makes change detection on a time series and does visualizations through web-based environments by using multiple languages such as JavaScript and Python.
